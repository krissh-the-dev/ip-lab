    Arulmigu Subramaniyaswami Temple, Marudamalai. The colorful and intricately carved Arulmigu Patteeswarar Swamy
    Temple
    lies southeast of here. In the center, the Gass Forest Museum has a huge collection of preserved animals and tree
    trunks. Southeast, birds and butterflies inhabit Singanallur Lake.
